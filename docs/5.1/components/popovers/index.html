<p>Things to know when using the popover plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Popovers rely on the third party library <a href="https://popper.js.org/">Popper</a> for positioning. You must include <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js">popper.min.js</a> before <code>bootstrap.js</code>, or use one <code>bootstrap.bundle.min.js</code> which contains Popper.</li>
<li>Popovers require the <a href="https://princetonuniversityoit.github.io/jazz-boot/docs/5.1/components/tooltips/">tooltip plugin</a> as a dependency.</li>
<li>Popovers are opt-in for performance reasons, so <strong>you must initialize them yourself</strong>.</li>
<li>Zero-length <code>title</code> and <code>content</code> values will never show a popover.</li>
<li>Specify <code>container: 'body'</code> to avoid rendering problems in more complex components (like our input groups, button groups, etc).</li>
<li>Triggering popovers on hidden elements will not work.</li>
<li>Popovers for <code>.disabled</code> or <code>disabled</code> elements must be triggered on a wrapper element.</li>
<li>When triggered from anchors that wrap across multiple lines, popovers will be centered between the anchors&rsquo; overall width. Use <code>.text-nowrap</code> on your <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s to avoid this behavior.</li>
<li>Popovers must be hidden before their corresponding elements have been removed from the DOM.</li>
<li>Popovers can be triggered thanks to an element inside a shadow DOM.</li>
</ul>

<p>Elements with the <code>disabled</code> attribute aren&rsquo;t interactive, meaning users cannot hover or click them to trigger a popover (or tooltip).

<h3 id="making-popovers-work-for-keyboard-and-assistive-technology-users">Making popovers work for keyboard and assistive technology users <a class="anchor-link" href="#making-popovers-work-for-keyboard-and-assistive-technology-users" aria-label="Link to this section: Making popovers work for keyboard and assistive technology users"></a></h3>
<p>To allow keyboard users to activate your popovers, you should only add them to HTML elements that are traditionally keyboard-focusable and interactive (such as links or form controls). Although arbitrary HTML elements (such as <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s) can be made focusable by adding the <code>tabindex=&quot;0&quot;</code> attribute, this will add potentially annoying and confusing tab stops on non-interactive elements for keyboard users, and most assistive technologies currently do not announce the popover&rsquo;s content in this situation. Additionally, do not rely solely on <code>hover</code> as the trigger for your popovers, as this will make them impossible to trigger for keyboard users.</p>
<p>While you can insert rich, structured HTML in popovers with the <code>html</code> option, we strongly recommend that you avoid adding an excessive amount of content. The way popovers currently work is that, once displayed, their content is tied to the trigger element with the <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute. As a result, the entirety of the popover&rsquo;s content will be announced to assistive technology users as one long, uninterrupted stream.</p>
<p>Additionally, while it is possible to also include interactive controls (such as form elements or links) in your popover (by adding these elements to the <code>allowList</code> of allowed attributes and tags), be aware that currently the popover does not manage keyboard focus order. When a keyboard user opens a popover, focus remains on the triggering element, and as the popover usually does not immediately follow the trigger in the document&rsquo;s structure, there is no guarantee that moving forward/pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> will move a keyboard user into the popover itself. In short, simply adding interactive controls to a popover is likely to make these controls unreachable/unusable for keyboard users and users of assistive technologies, or at the very least make for an illogical overall focus order. In these cases, consider using a modal dialog instead.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="options">Options <a class="anchor-link" href="#options" aria-label="Link to this section: Options"></a></h3>
<p>Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to <code>data-bs-</code>, as in <code>data-bs-animation=&quot;&quot;</code>. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from camelCase to kebab-case when passing the options via data attributes. For example, instead of using <code>data-bs-customClass=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code>, use <code>data-bs-custom-class=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code>.</p>
