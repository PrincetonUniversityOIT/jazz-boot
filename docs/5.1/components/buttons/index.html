<p>Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies â such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the <code>.visually-hidden</code> class.

<h2 id="disable-text-wrapping">Disable text wrapping <a class="anchor-link" href="#disable-text-wrapping" aria-label="Link to this section: Disable text wrapping"></a></h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want the button text to wrap, you can add the <code>.text-nowrap</code> class to the button. In Sass, you can set <code>$btn-white-space: nowrap</code> to disable text wrapping for each button.</p>
<h2 id="button-tags">Button tags <a class="anchor-link" href="#button-tags" aria-label="Link to this section: Button tags"></a></h2>
<p>The <code>.btn</code> classes are designed to be used with the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element. However, you can also use these classes on <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements (though some browsers may apply a slightly different rendering).</p>
<p>When using button classes on <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements that are used to trigger in-page functionality (like collapsing content), rather than linking to new pages or sections within the current page, these links should be given a <code>role=&quot;button&quot;</code> to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>

<p>Disabled buttons using the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element behave a bit different:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s don&rsquo;t support the <code>disabled</code> attribute, so you must add the <code>.disabled</code> class to make it visually appear disabled.</li>
<li>Some future-friendly styles are included to disable all <code>pointer-events</code> on anchor buttons.</li>
<li>Disabled buttons using <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> should include the <code>aria-disabled=&quot;true&quot;</code> attribute to indicate the state of the element to assistive technologies.</li>
<li>Disabled buttons using <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> <em>should not</em> include the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>

<h3 id="link-functionality-caveat">Link functionality caveat <a class="anchor-link" href="#link-functionality-caveat" aria-label="Link to this section: Link functionality caveat"></a></h3>
<p>To cover cases where you have to keep the <code>href</code> attribute on a disabled link, the <code>.disabled</code> class uses <code>pointer-events: none</code> to try to disable the link functionality of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s. Note that this CSS property is not yet standardized for HTML, but all modern browsers support it. In addition, even in browsers that do support <code>pointer-events: none</code>, keyboard navigation remains unaffected, meaning that sighted keyboard users and users of assistive technologies will still be able to activate these links. So to be safe, in addition to <code>aria-disabled=&quot;true&quot;</code>, also include a <code>tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;</code> attribute on these links to prevent them from receiving keyboard focus, and use custom JavaScript to disable their functionality altogether.</p>

<p>Here we create a responsive variation, starting with vertically stacked buttons until the <code>md</code> breakpoint, where <code>.d-md-block</code> replaces the <code>.d-grid</code> class, thus nullifying the <code>gap-2</code> utility. Resize your browser to see them change.</p>

<p>You can adjust the width of your block buttons with grid column width classes. For example, for a half-width &ldquo;block button&rdquo;, use <code>.col-6</code>. Center it horizontally with <code>.mx-auto</code>, too.</p>

<p>Additional utilities can be used to adjust the alignment of buttons when horizontal. Here we&rsquo;ve taken our previous responsive example and added some flex utilities and a margin utility on the button to right align the buttons when they&rsquo;re no longer stacked.</p>

<h2 id="button-plugin">Button plugin <a class="anchor-link" href="#button-plugin" aria-label="Link to this section: Button plugin"></a></h2>
<p>The button plugin allows you to create simple on/off toggle buttons.</p>
<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
Visually, these toggle buttons are identical to the <a href="https://princetonuniversityoit.github.io/jazz-boot/docs/5.1/forms/checks-radios/#checkbox-toggle-buttons">checkbox toggle buttons</a>. However, they are conveyed differently by assistive technologies: the checkbox toggles will be announced by screen readers as &ldquo;checked&rdquo;/&ldquo;not checked&rdquo; (since, despite their appearance, they are fundamentally still checkboxes), whereas these toggle buttons will be announced as &ldquo;button&rdquo;/&ldquo;button pressed&rdquo;. The choice between these two approaches will depend on the type of toggle you are creating, and whether or not the toggle will make sense to users when announced as a checkbox or as an actual button.

<h3 id="toggle-states">Toggle states <a class="anchor-link" href="#toggle-states" aria-label="Link to this section: Toggle states"></a></h3>
<p>Add <code>data-bs-toggle=&quot;button&quot;</code> to toggle a button&rsquo;s <code>active</code> state. If you&rsquo;re pre-toggling a button, you must manually add the <code>.active</code> class <strong>and</strong> <code>aria-pressed=&quot;true&quot;</code> to ensure that it is conveyed appropriately to assistive technologies.</p>
