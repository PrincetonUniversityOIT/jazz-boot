<h3 id="new-_mapsscss">New <code>_maps.scss</code> <a class="anchor-link" href="#new-_mapsscss" aria-label="Link to this section: New _maps.scss"></a></h3>
<p>Bootstrap v5.2.0 introduced a new Sass file, <code>_maps.scss</code>, that pulled out several Sass maps from <code>_variables.scss</code> to fix an issue where updates to an original map were not applied to secondary maps that extend them. For example, updates to <code>$theme-colors</code> were not being applied to other theme maps that relied on <code>$theme-colors</code>, breaking key customization workflows. In short, Sass has a limitation where once a default variable or map has been <em>used</em>, it cannot be updated.</p>
<p>This is why variable customizations in Bootstrap have to come after <code>@import &quot;functions&quot;</code>, but before <code>@import &quot;variables&quot;</code> and the rest of our import stack. The same applies to Sass mapsâyou must override the defaults before the defaults get used. The following maps have been moved to the new <code>_maps.scss</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$theme-colors-rgb</code></li>
<li><code>$utilities-colors</code></li>
<li><code>$utilities-text</code></li>
<li><code>$utilities-text-colors</code></li>
<li><code>$utilities-bg</code></li>
<li><code>$utilities-bg-colors</code></li>
<li><code>$negative-spacers</code></li>
<li><code>$gutters</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Your custom Bootstrap CSS builds should now look something like this with a separate maps import.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Introduced new <code>$enable-container-classes</code> option.</strong> Now when opting into the experimental CSS Grid layout, <code>.container-*</code> classes will still be compiled, unless this option is set to <code>false</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thicker table dividers are now opt-in.</strong> We&rsquo;ve removed the thicker and more difficult to override border between table groups and moved it to an optional class you can apply, <code>.table-group-divider</code>. <a href="https://pucsidesignsystemtest.z13.web.core.windows.net/docs/5.1/content/tables/#table-group-dividers">See the table docs for an example.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Popovers and tooltips now use CSS variables.</strong> Both components have been updated to use CSS variables on their base classes, <code>.popover</code> and <code>.tooltip</code>. Some CSS variables have been updated from their Sass counterparts to reduce the number of variables. As a result, three variables have been deprecated in this release: <code>$popover-arrow-color</code>, <code>$popover-arrow-outer-color</code>, and <code>$tooltip-arrow-color</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>We&rsquo;ve ditched the default Sass map merges to make it easier to remove redundant values. Keep in mind you now have to define all values in the Sass maps like <code>$theme-colors</code>.

<li>
<p><span class="badge bg-danger">Breaking</span> Media query mixins parameters have changed for a more logical approach.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>media-breakpoint-down()</code> uses the breakpoint itself instead of the next breakpoint (e.g., <code>media-breakpoint-down(lg)</code> instead of <code>media-breakpoint-down(md)</code> targets viewports smaller than <code>lg</code>).</li>
<li>Similarly, the second parameter in <code>media-breakpoint-between()</code> also uses the breakpoint itself instead of the next breakpoint (e.g., <code>media-between(sm, lg)</code> instead of <code>media-breakpoint-between(sm, md)</code> targets viewports between <code>sm</code> and <code>lg</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge bg-danger">Breaking</span> Removed print styles and <code>$enable-print-styles</code> variable. Print display classes are still around. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/28339">See #28339</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge bg-danger">Breaking</span> Dropped <code>color()</code>, <code>theme-color()</code>, and <code>gray()</code> functions in favor of variables. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/29083">See #29083</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>theme-color-level()</code> function to <code>color-level()</code> and now accepts any color you want instead of only <code>$theme-color</code> colors. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/29083">See #29083</a> <strong>Watch out:</strong> <code>color-level()</code> was later on dropped in <code>v5.0.0-alpha3</code>.</p>

</li>
<li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>scale-color()</code> function to <code>shift-color()</code> to avoid collision with Sass&rsquo;s own color scaling function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>box-shadow</code> mixins now allow <code>null</code> values and drop <code>none</code> from multiple arguments. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30394">See #30394</a>.</p>

<h2 id="color-system">Color system <a class="anchor-link" href="#color-system" aria-label="Link to this section: Color system"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The color system which worked with <code>color-level()</code> and <code>$theme-color-interval</code> was removed in favor of a new color system. All <code>lighten()</code> and <code>darken()</code> functions in our codebase are replaced by <code>tint-color()</code> and <code>shade-color()</code>. These functions will mix the color with either white or black instead of changing its lightness by a fixed amount. The <code>shift-color()</code> will either tint or shade a color depending on whether its weight parameter is positive or negative. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30622">See #30622</a> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new tints and shades for every color, providing nine separate colors for each base color, as new Sass variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved color contrast. Bumped color contrast ratio from 3:1 to 4.5:1 and updated blue, green, cyan, and pink colors to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA contrast. Also changed our color contrast color from <code>$gray-900</code> to <code>$black</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support our color system, we&rsquo;ve added new custom <code>tint-color()</code> and <code>shade-color()</code> functions to mix our colors appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="grid-updates">Grid updates <a class="anchor-link" href="#grid-updates" aria-label="Link to this section: Grid updates"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>New breakpoint!</strong> Added new <code>xxl</code> breakpoint for <code>1400px</code> and up. No changes to all other breakpoints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved gutters.</strong> Gutters are now set in rems, and are narrower than v4 (<code>1.5rem</code>, or about <code>24px</code>, down from <code>30px</code>). This aligns our grid system&rsquo;s gutters with our spacing utilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new <a href="https://pucsidesignsystemtest.z13.web.core.windows.net/docs/5.1/layout/gutters/">gutter class</a> (<code>.g-*</code>, <code>.gx-*</code>, and <code>.gy-*</code>) to control horizontal/vertical gutters, horizontal gutters, and vertical gutters.</li>
<li><span class="badge bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>.no-gutters</code> to <code>.g-0</code> to match new gutter utilities.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge bg-danger">Breaking</span> <code>bootstrap-grid.css</code> now only applies <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> to the column instead of resetting the global box-sizing. This way, our grid styles can be used in more places without interference.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge bg-danger">Breaking</span> Overhauled our display typography to replace our <code>$display-*</code> variables and with a <code>$display-font-sizes</code> Sass map. Also removed the individual <code>$display-*-weight</code> variables for a single <code>$display-font-weight</code> and adjusted <code>font-size</code>s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added two new <code>.display-*</code> heading sizes, <code>.display-5</code> and <code>.display-6</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Links are underlined by default</strong> (not just on hover), unless they&rsquo;re part of specific components.</p>

<p><strong>Redesigned tables</strong> to refresh their styles and rebuild them with CSS variables for more control over styling.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge bg-danger">Breaking</span> The <code>table-row-variant()</code> mixin is renamed to <code>table-variant()</code> and accepts only 2 parameters: <code>$color</code> (color name) and <code>$value</code> (color code).

<p><span class="badge bg-danger">Breaking</span> <del><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> elements now use <code>height</code> instead of <code>border</code> to better support the <code>size</code> attribute.
