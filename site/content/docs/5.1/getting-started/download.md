## Compiled CSS and JS

Download ready-to-use compiled code for **Bootstrap v{{< param current_version >}}** to easily drop into your project, which includes:

- Compiled and minified CSS bundles (see [CSS files comparison]({{< docsref "/getting-started/contents#css-files" >}}))
- Compiled and minified JavaScript plugins (see [JS files comparison]({{< docsref "/getting-started/contents#js-files" >}}))

This doesn't include documentation, source files, or any optional JavaScript dependencies like Popper.

## Source files

Compile Bootstrap with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source Sass, JavaScript, and documentation files. This option requires some additional tooling:

- [Sass compiler]({{< docsref "/getting-started/contribute#sass" >}}) for compiling Sass source files into CSS files
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for CSS vendor prefixing

Should you require our full set of [build tools]({{< docsref "/getting-started/contribute#tooling-setup" >}}), they are included for developing Bootstrap and its docs, but they're likely unsuitable for your own purposes.

## Examples

If you want to download and examine our [examples]({{< docsref "/examples" >}}), you can grab the already built examples:

## Package managers

Pull in Bootstrap's **source files** into nearly any project with some of the most popular package managers. No matter the package manager, Bootstrap will **require a [Sass compiler]({{< docsref "/getting-started/contribute#sass" >}}) and [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)** for a setup that matches our official compiled versions.

### npm

Install the Jazz Design System in your Node.js powered apps with [the npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap):

```sh
npm install @princeton-design/design-system
```

`const bootstrap = require('bootstrap')` or `import bootstrap from 'bootstrap'` will load all of Bootstrap's plugins onto a `bootstrap` object.
The `bootstrap` module itself exports all of our plugins. You can manually load Bootstrap's plugins individually by loading the `/js/dist/*.js` files under the package's top-level directory.

Bootstrap's `package.json` contains some additional metadata under the following keys:

- `sass` - path to Bootstrap's main [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) source file
- `style` - path to Bootstrap's non-minified CSS that's been precompiled using the default settings (no customization)

### yarn

Install the Jazz Design System in your Node.js powered apps with [the yarn package](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/bootstrap):

```sh
yarn add @princeton-design/design-system
```
